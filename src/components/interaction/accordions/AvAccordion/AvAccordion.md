# Accordions - `AvAccordion`

## 🌟 Introduction

The `AvAccordion` is a declarative component used exclusively in the `default` slot of `AvAccordionsGroup`.
`AvAccordion` allows you to configure an accordion by passing its props (such as `title` and `icon`) to the `AvAccordionsGroup` component without rendering.

It acts as a proxy component: it exposes information (props) used by `AvAccordionsGroup` to generate the interface.

🚫 This component does not display anything by itself and should not be used outside `AvAccordion`.
